# Music App Project

## Overview
This Music App is a Java-based project that demonstrates the creation and management of music albums and playlists. It includes classes for representing songs and albums, and a main class that showcases how these elements can be used together.

## Features
- **Sophisticated Song Management**: Enables defining songs with intricate details like titles and durations.
- **Robust Album Management**: Efficiently organizes songs into albums, showcasing data structuring and management.
- **Dynamic Playlist Management**: Allows for the compilation of songs from various albums into playlists, demonstrating the application's flexibility and user-focused design.
- **Interactive Playback Simulation**: Features a console-based interface for simulating the music playback experience, emphasizing user interaction and command-line proficiency.

## Project Structure
The application comprises three primary classes, each exemplifying best practices in object-oriented programming:
- `Song.java`: Implements the Song object, encapsulating title and duration properties.
- `Album.java`: Manages a collection of Song objects, providing album-related functionalities.
- `Main.java`: Serves as the entry point of the application, facilitating user interactions and seamlessly integrating the Album and Song classes' functionalities.
